I have Created a superhero hunter app using ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks allowed for Javascript.
This app has following features stated below.
FEATURES:
=>Home Page
1. Search any superhero from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like     Google does for suggestions).
2. Each search result of the superhero should have a favourite button, clicking on which the superhero should be added to “My favourite      superheroes” (a list).
3. On clicking any particular search result (any superhero), open a new page with more information about that superhero (Superhero page).
   
=>Superhero Page
1. Should show a lot of information about the superhero like their name, photo, powerstats, bio (these are must, rest you can add if you want).

=> My favourite superheroes Page
1. Display a list of all the favourite superheroes.
2. Make this list persistent (should have the same number of superheroes before and after closing the browser).
3. Remove from favourites button: Each superhero should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that superhero from the list.
